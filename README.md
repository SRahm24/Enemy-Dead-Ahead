# Game Features:

## Grid Setup:

Create a grid system representing the ocean.
Each cell of the grid corresponds to a specific coordinate on the map.

## Ship Placement:

Randomly place ships on the grid.
Ensure ships do not overlap and fit within the boundaries of the grid.

## Targeting Mechanics:

Allow the player to select a plot on the grid to target; the grid is updated to reflect hits and misses.

## Timer Mechanism:

Implement a timer to limit the time players have to select a plot.
If time runs out, the player's turn is skipped.
